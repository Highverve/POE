# Pilgrimage of Embers

*Pilgrimage of Embers* is a dark fantasy action role-playing game. I first started working on this game when I was 17, teaching myself coding and art design skills along the way.

Since this project was originally coded in Vistual Studio 2015, and I didn't use GitHub at the time, I had difficulties migrating the code to the 2022 version. I've decided to just upload the old code directly for your reference. You can still play the alpha release of the game by downloading the release in the right panel. Additionally, I've uploaded the entire .zip containing all of the Pilgirmage of Embers devlogs from *Emberium Studios* (rebranded from *Enckling Games*).
